------------Animated Planets------------

There are 35 planet-prefabs and 3 sun-prefabs in the prefab-folder. 
You're free to use them as you see fit and even mix and match their material properties to create new planets.

Most prefabs are animated, you can set the animation's speed and offset using the Loopduration and Loopoffset properties in the "AnimatingMatBehaviour"-script attached to these prefab.
Loopduration: the time in seconds it takes for the entire animation to play through.
Loopoffset: The starting point in the animation. (0: start at beginning, 0.5: start halfway, 1: start at the end (which is the same as starting at the beginning as it loops)

Planets that have city-lights have the "DayNightMaterialBehaviour"-script, which makes the lights only be visible on the night-side of the planet. 
You need to assign the main light in the scene as the sun property to have it work correctly.

There is also a Space Skybox for you to use
